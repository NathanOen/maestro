# maestro

The Project Maestro is inspired when I was attending one of my niece music recetil. I can't sing and play music. However it's dawn on me when watching a conductor, a maestro, with their students playing nice musics it reminds me of Disney's Mickey's Fantasia. 

Imagine that each of music chair/desk is AI powered Hand Phones or devices that can watch our hand and coordinatingly could play music on our choice generatively. Imagine Fantasia comes to live. Welcome to Project Maestro.
